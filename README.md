## Project Question : What is the effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on cerebral perfusion in the visual cortex (V5//MT) in Lewy Body Dementia patients who experience visual hallucinations? 

## Our approach: what we need to research & model

  1. Model the effects of a lack of cholinergic neurotransmission in the autonomic nervous system on cerebral perfusion (Acetylcholine acts as a vasodialator)
  2. Model the effects (Activation Level) of a decreased flow of blood to the visual cortex (V5/MT)
  3. Determine of effects of introducing cholinesterase inhibitors on self-produced dementia patient models
