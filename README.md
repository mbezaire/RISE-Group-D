# Our approach: what we need to research & model
 - How a lack of cholinergic neurotransmission (muscarinic receptors? - M5 receptors in the blood vessels) results in a lack of blood flow to the brain 
 - How that lack of blood flow impairs visual processing (in the V5/MT area? - this area sends signals to the association areas, first area to appear abnormal in lewy body patients)
 - How using ChEIs can be used to increase acetylcholine transfer to fix these problems

## Project Question : How can cholinesterase inhibitors be used to inhibit enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of acetylcholine to increase cerebral perfusion in the visual cortex in Lewy Body Dementia patients who experience visual hallucinations?
