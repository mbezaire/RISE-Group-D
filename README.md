## Project Title :
Modeling the effects of changes in cerebral perfusion on visual processing in the V5/MT visual cortex that causes visual hallucinations in Lewy Body Dementia patients

## Biological Background
1. Lewy Body Dementia patients (LBD) have a deficit in choline acetyltransferase activity (the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of acetylcholine) which creates a lack of cerebral perfusion (acetylcholine normally acts as a vasodilator to prevent muscles from tightening and walls from narrowing to allow blood to flow through arteries more easily).
2. Glucose metabolism in the brain involves the transfer of glucose and oxygen via the bloodstream for the brain cells to generate energy. Studies of LBD patients have shown that different areas of the brain, specifically the occipital lobe, have hypometabolism as a result of a reduction in blood flow , meaning that less glucose and oxygen are available for the cells. 
3. There is altered synaptic function and specifically GABA dysfunction in LBD patients. This is likely related to the hypometabolism seen in these patients, as studies support the possibility that blood flow is reduced with reduced GABA activity.
4. In LBD patients, there is a negative relationship between phosphene threshold and BOLD activity, suggesting a loss of inhibition.
